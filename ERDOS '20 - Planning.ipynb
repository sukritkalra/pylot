    "3. __Prediction__: Estimates how other agents would move in the environment.\n",

    "ERDOS models the AV pipeline as a directed dataflow graph where developers implement the components of the pipeline as __*operators*__ that communicate with each other through typed __*streams*__. Operators can request callbacks upon receipt of messages on a stream, and send the computed results to other operators via a different stream. For example, a __*planning*__ component computes the trajectory of the AV based on the predictions sent by the __*prediction*__ module, and sends it to the __*control*__ module to physically operate the AV.\n",

Upon receipt of the message, the `on_prediction_update` method is invoked which retrieves the predictions from the message for the planning algorithm to use. However, the initial implementation returns an empty list from the predictions, which tells the planner that there are no obstacles to plan around. \n",

    "2. Instead of returning the empty list, return the correct predictions by retrieving them from the `message` using `message.predictions`. \n",
