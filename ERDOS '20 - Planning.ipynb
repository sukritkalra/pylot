    "3. __Prediction__: Estimates how other agents would move in the environment.\n",

    "ERDOS models the AV pipeline as a directed dataflow graph where developers implement the components of the pipeline as __*operators*__ that communicate with each other through typed __*streams*__. Operators can request callbacks upon receipt of messages on a stream, and send the computed results to other operators via a different stream. For example, a __*planning*__ component computes the trajectory of the AV based on the predictions sent by the __*prediction*__ module, and sends it to the __*control*__ module to physically operate the AV.\n",

Upon receipt of the message, the `on_prediction_update` method is invoked which retrieves new predictions from the message for the planning algorithm to use. However, the initial implementation returns an empty list of predictions, which incorrectly notifies the planner that there are no obstacles to plan around. \n",

    "A smaller value of both the space and the time discretization ensures a smoother trajectory of the vehicle by generating waypoints that are close to each other, and hence easier for the control module to follow. However, this fine-grained discretization comes at the cost of an increased runtime of the planner which leads to an increased end-to-end response time. On the other hand, the planner might fail to find a feasible trajectory with a coarse-grained discretization of space and time.\n",

    "[Exercise 2](#exercise_2) showed us that a static configuration of these hyperparameters does not allow the AV to prevent a collison across various driving speeds. To ensure safety of the AV across different driving speeds, [ERDOS](https://github.com/erdos-project/erdos) enables an AV pipeline such as [Pylot](https://github.com/erdos-project/pylot) to adjust the runtime of each component in order to ensure the best accuracy for a given environment. For example, the pipeline might choose to run a faster object-detection model that has a lower accuracy in order to allocate more time to the planning module.
